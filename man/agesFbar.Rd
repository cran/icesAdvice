\title{Age Range for Fbar}
\usage{
agesFbar(cn, probs = c(0.1, 0.9), plot = FALSE, main = NULL,
  xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cn}{a vector, matrix, table, or data frame containing the catch at age
as integers or decimal values. Ages are indicated in names if
\code{cn} is a vector, or in column names if \code{cn} is a matrix,
table, or data frame.}

\item{probs}{a vector of probabilities, e.g. \code{c(0.1, 0.9)} to calculate
the age range that covers 80\% of the catch.}

\item{plot}{whether to indicate the cut points on a bar plot.}

\item{main}{passed to \code{barplot}.}

\item{xlab}{passed to \code{barplot}.}

\item{ylab}{passed to \code{barplot}.}

\item{col}{passed to \code{barplot}.}
}
\value{
Vector of two values, the lower and upper age. These can be rounded to
construct an Fbar age range.
}
\description{
Calculate a suitable age range for average fishing mortality (Fbar).
}
\note{
The calculations are more complicated than traditional quantiles, since the
ages for Fbar are discrete and not continuous. For example, with a continuous
variable, Fbar[5-6] has width one, but for a discrete variable it has width
two.

The algorithm cuts off exactly \code{probs[1]} and \code{1-probs[2]} from the
left and right tails of the distribution and returns the corresponding values
that can be rounded with a simple \code{round(agesFbar(x))} to get a discrete
age range that covers close to \code{diff(probs)} of the catch.

With \code{plot = TRUE}, the white bars are outside the Fbar age range and
the dark gray bars are inside it. The bars affected by the lower and upper
cut points are drawn in a shade between white and dark gray, providing a
visual cue whether that age should be in the Fbar age range or not.

The calculated limits are somewhat unintuitive for interpretation, but they
are statistically precise and unbiased. A lower limit of 6.8 means that 80\%
of age six was cut off the left tail, so rounding the lower age of Fbar to 7
appropriate. An upper limit of 14.1 means that all of age 14 and 10\% of age
15 is inside the range, so rounding the upper age of Fbar to 14 is
appropriate. See \code{plot = TRUE} example below.
